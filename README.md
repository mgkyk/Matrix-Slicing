# Matrix Slicing

## Input: (matrix, position)
A 2-dimensional matrix
position=(A, B)

## Output: matrix
The output is a new matrix. 
This program will delete all the data in Ath row or Bth column in the origin matrix, cutting the matrix into several small pieces, and join the remain pieces into a new matrix.

## Demo
input:


matrix = 


[


[1, 2,  3,  4]


[5, 6,  7,  8]


[9, 10, 11, 12]


]



postion = [1, 2]


output:


new_matrix = 


[


[ 1 2  4]


[ 9 10 12]


]
